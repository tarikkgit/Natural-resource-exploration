Requirements
When the application starts for the first time, it should prompt the user to enter the row number of the coordinate points to be plotted, the unit drilling cost, and the unit platform cost. (The drawing process should only be performed for the points in a single row.)
Two separate drawings should be made within the program.
In the first drawing, a reserve area created by the specified points should be plotted and visually presented to the user.
The reserve value should be calculated based on the drawn areas and shown to the user. (Reserve value = surface area of the reserve regions x 10) (In cases with multiple reserve regions, the total reserve value should be displayed to the user.)
In the second drawing, a partitioning process should be executed to achieve the minimum total cost, and the reserve area should be plotted as divided into square sections visually. Different sizes of square sections should be represented in different colors.
After the second drawing, the user should be presented with the total number of platforms, total number of drills, total platform cost, total drilling cost, total cost (i.e., total drilling cost + total platform cost), and profit amount (i.e., reserve value - total cost).
